                    <p>On default, I'm a storyteller. I love telling and listening to stories, be they real or imagined. 
Every story I've ever heard have three things in common - a beginning, an end, and "flavor" in the middle.

That is the kind of tech professional I hope to become. One who gets the job done from start to finish, but with a little bit of flavor in the middle. 

So far, I've completed a two year Professional Diploma course in Network Engineering at the National Institute of Information Technology (NIIT), Ghana, now known as OpenLabs Ghana.</p>

<p>6 months before completing the course, I was "drafted" by a tech startup known as Cradle Information Systems where I served as Systems Administrator for the next 9 months. Among tasks such as hardware repairs, troubleshooting, software installations and acquiring/renewing OEM certifications, I also managed the company's social media accounts, designed and uploaded content, (postings were admittedly inconsistent) handled the role of junior sales executive, all the while keeping the office areas neat and tidy.

Soon, I received admission to Regent University College of Science and Technology to pursue a degree in Information Systems Science.</p> 

<p>With some free time on my hands, a few gigabytes and a good mentor, I did what any Alvin would do. I studied (downloaded a few Hindi movies too) and grew fascinated with the field of Software Engineering. I consumed as much information as my ISP would permit and practiced the little i learned under the guidance of my mentor. After exploring, C, Python, HTML and CSS, SQL, and now, React, I sat up to type all this. 

Just as a fisherman would lower his best bait into the ocean, I have lowered a portion of my self, now all that's left is to reel in the catch.
